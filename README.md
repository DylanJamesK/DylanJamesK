- 👋 Hi, I’m @DylanJamesK , but you can call me Dylan!
- 👀 I’m interested in augmented/virtual reality development, web development, branding/graphic design, LiDAR/CAD modeling towards living 'digital twins', computer vision, IoT, animation, and music!  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++/C# for development within Unreal Engine/Unity and computer-generated art using Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects involving music (specifically hip hop/ R&B) or XR development.
