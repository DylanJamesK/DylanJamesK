- 👋 Hi, I’m @DylanJamesK , but you can call me Dylan!
- 👀 I’m interested in User Experience Design, AR/VR Development, Web Development, Branding / Graphic design, & Motion and Sound Design!  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React to take more of my website and app ideas from designs to fully functional prototypes. I have also been learning more about webscraping using Python to utilize data in creative ways as well as some C# and C++ for writing scripts within Unity / Unreal Engine.
- 💞️ Recently, I have been interested in helping small/medium business owners revamp their personal brands and online presence. In general, I'm drawn toward any projects involving music, game design, or immersive experiences.
- 📫 You can reach me by email at dyljameskerr@gmail.com !
